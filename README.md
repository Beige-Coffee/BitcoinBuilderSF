## â‚¿uilder ðŸ‘‹

â‚¿uilder is a monthly meetup focused on discussing product, design, and AI tools for individuals building on bitcoin. Everyone is welcome, whether you're an experienced product manager or designer, just starting out, or simply curious to learn.

Each month there will be a topic list that is community-generated on Github. Have a topic? Submit it here for consideration. 

The moderators will compile all the ideas into an ordered list to guide the discussion. 

Audience participation is not only encouraged but is a required part of this meetup, whether by asking questions or sharing information and opinions on each topic. There will also be opportunities for live demos, allowing attendees to showcase their projects.

Here are some example topics:
1. New bitcoin products
2. Tools such as vibecoding, SDKs, and design guides
3. Metrics covering bitcoin usage
4. Bitcoin design best practices
5. Emerging and potential bitcoin startups
6. Use cases for bitcoin
7. The impact of tax and policies for product builders

The meetup will occur at Presidio Bitcoin every fourth Thursday of the month. Follow [@bbBuilderSF](https://x.com/bbBuilderSF) for updates. Letâ€™s get â‚¿uilding!
